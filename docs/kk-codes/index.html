		<h1>The guide on everything you need to know about KK Codes!</h1>
		<p>
			<br><br><br><br>
			KK Codes, are codes that start with "KK".<br>
			The main example is "KK402411". You may think it says "Kall", but no, it isn't.<br>
			It actually means "Crack".<br><br><br>
			KK Codes, the numbers actually make you think they form a word, but no.<br>
			The codes try to trick you.<br>
			In order to know what the code means, you need to use the New Char Code (NCC).<br>
			The way they would look like is it would become an anagram.<br>
			<br><br><br>
			Made by Alexander Char<br>
			12 May 1983<br>
			<br>
			Made for my grandson Newton Reximal Char to understand the KK Codes,<br>
			which I implemented into his code, the NCC.
